*This is a class project to test our web programming skills. 
We were asked to a find a problem that can be solved by creating a web application.
Our idea is to create a school admission system web application that will replace the traditional one as described below;*

# Everest Admission System

## INTRODUCTION

Everest Schools is a chain of secondary schools located in Dar es Salaam and Arusha. Their primary mission is to provide top-notch education to their beloved students. To accomplish the mission, they have to admit the most disciplined and best students in academics. So far, they have been using the traditional interview system which has proved not to be effective because students have to travel long distances to attend the exam. Also, it is costly to pay for the stationaries and teachers for marking the exams. However, the management has agreed on creating a web application that will enable students no matter where they are to be interviewed and get their admission results online. The web application will allow students to fill in the application form, attempt the examination, and get their results faster than the traditional way they are used to.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

The traditional system they have been using is costly and not effective where both the school and students have to incur costs to attend the interview. Therefore, the creation of a web application to automate the whole admission process will save both parties involved time and money.


## PROPOSED SOLUTION

### 3.1. Main objective

To create a web application which will allow users (students) to fill in the application form, attempt the examination, and get their results faster than the traditional way we are used to.

### 3.2. Specific objectives

The specific objectives required for the completion of this project are as follows;

- Brainstorming the main features of the app
- Brainstorming and coming up with the system design
- Coming up with database design
- Prototyping and designing the application
- Creating a login and registration page
- Creating a dashboard which will contain the application form examination and admission results
- Creating a database for the storing data
- Creating a GitHub project repository and pushing our projects to it
- Testing the application
- Delivering presentation

## SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT

The following are the significance of a web application over the traditional system as follows;

- Saves the school the costs of conducting interviews like hiring staff and stationaries 
- Saves the students the costs of travelling long distance and accommodation.
- Gives out the admission results much faster compared to the traditional system.
